Sveltekit Svelte

Building at the intersection of AI and the physical world.

🚁 **[dronelist.io](https://dronelist.io)** (closed source) – AI-powered revenue intelligence platform for drone operators.

Current Projects

🏦 **[that money app](https://github.com/dopiotrek/that-money-app)** - a personal finance tracker

## What I'm Building

- **dronelist.io** – Helping drone operators run their businesses smarter
- **Learning frameworks** – Tools for systematic knowledge compression and decomposition

## What I'm Exploring

- **AI meets physical constraints** – Infrastructure bottlenecks, mineral dependencies, the gap between software-speed expectations and hardware reality
- **Hardware skills** – Arduino, PCB design, CAD, 3D printing
- **Robotics** – Where software meets the real world

## Background

15 years across financial services & tech & aviation. Now channeling that into building products.

## Philosophy

Engineering is art. I find fulfillment in elegant system architecture and immediate feedback loops. Building things that work in the physical world, not just on screens.
